Grimes meets the employees and is immediately stunned at Homer's lackadasial work performance and his co-workers are nonchalant about it. Grimes - already annoyed by Homer's habits - becomes horrified when he observes Homer nearly drink a flask containing a toxic acid in absent-mindedness; however, Grimes is harshly reprimanded when he knocks the vial away and causes damage. Grimes tells Homer that they are "enemies," but Homer - still wanting to be friends - invites "Grimey" over for dinner. However, the attempt only makes matters worse when Grimes sees that Homer is living in a nice home and has a family. Resolved to expose Homer as a fraud once and for all, he hands out a flyer announcing a "design your own power plant" contest, which has all references to this being a contest for elementary school students. However, Homer easily wins the contest, causing Grimes to go crazy. After running amok through the plant and mocking Homer, Grimes touches some electrical wires and is electrocuted. In the subplot, Bart wanders into public auction and submits the winning bid ($1) for an abandoned factory. Bart and Milhouse play around inside until the place crumbles.*(1989 TV Series)*

The only ones not to get sick are Bart (who didn't want to eat the spoiled oysters), and Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel, who fall in love with each other. Bart catches his principal and teacher kissing passionately, but they immediately find out and want to swear him to secrecy. They make him his gofer, making his life miserable at school and calling him at all hours of the night (all for the reward of Milhouse inheriting Bart's poor school record). Bart eventually loses his patience and exposes the Skinner-Krabappel relationship. After rumors - most of them grossly exaggerated - begin running wild through town, Supt. Chalmers threatens to fire both Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel (since the relationship is forbidden per district policy) and does when Skinner refuses to call the relationship off. Eventually, Bart convinces Skinner to stand up for himself and his new girlfriend, and they decide to climb onto the roof and stay there until Chalmers reinstates them and accepts their relationship. The effort works, and Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel are back at school.*(1989 TV Series)*

The producers reason some new gimmicks are needed to inject fresh air and - after a focus group doesn't quite go as well as planned - decide to introduce a new character named Poochie, a rapping cartoon dog that is supposed to become friends with Itchy and Scratchy. Homer auditions to do Poochie's voice and wins the part. Poochie's first cartoon, "The Beagle Has Landed," premieres to great fanfare but is poorly received to say the least. The producers decide that, given his spectacular failure, Poochie will be killed off in the mutt's next cartoon. Homer learns about this and at his next recording session, gives a speech imploring everyone to give Poochie a chance. However, the effort is unsuccessful and Poochie's death - along with the correct lines dubbed in - is revealed in the next animated short. Also: A college-aged boy named Roy temporarily moves in with the Simpsons and - in a nod to clichd characters being used as a gimmick to entice viewership of waning TV shows - does everything to get in the way. Eventually, Roy announces he's moving out and moving in with a pair of sexy ladies.*(1989 TV Series)*
